        <p>The two prime suspects, Cherif and Said Kouachi, are said to have driven off in a Renault Clio car, apparently the same vehicle hijacked in Paris soon after the attack at Charlie Hebdo.<br><br>
        The highest security alert has been imposed in the Picardy region where police are searching for both men, officials say. Police have blocked a road running between the N2 road and the village of Longpont, where a witness says officers have been making house-to-house inquiries.<br></p>

            <p><b>East and West Mitten Buttes</b> are two distinctive geological features found within Monument Valley in northeast Navajo County, Arizona. The two buttes are about 0.6 mile from the Arizona-Utah state line and West Mitten Butte is 1.1 miles (1.8 km) northeast of the park headquarters. The summit of West Mitten Butte is 6,176 feet (1,882 m) in elevation and East Mitten Butte is 6,226 feet (1,898 m). The two form a triangle with Merrick's Butte about 2/3 of a mile to the south.<br><br>

            The buttes are made of three principal rock layers. The lowest layer is Organ Rock Shale, the middle is de Chelly Sandstone, and the top layer is the Moenkopi Formation capped by Shinarump Conglomerate. The buttes are also part of the Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park.</p>
